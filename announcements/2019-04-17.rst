Be aware that this is an initial release and is subject to breaking changes.
Find more information in the project `README
<https://github.com/dtr-org/unit-e/blob/master/README.md>`_.

You can participate in the testnet by following the instructions in the
:ref:`testnet` documentation. The testnet is at an early stage and it will
gradually be ramped up to provide more features. With the launch you will be
able to run a node to participate in the network. Facilities to generate testnet
tokens will be added in the future.
