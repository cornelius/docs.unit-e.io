The "block" message can be sent for two different reasons:

1. **GetData Response:** Nodes will always send it in response to a "getdata" message that requests the block with an inventory type of "MSG_BLOCK" (provided the node has that block available for relay).

2. **Unsolicited:** Some proposers will send unsolicited "block" messages broadcasting their newly-mined blocks to all of their peers.
