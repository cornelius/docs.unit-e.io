unit-e will, by default, disconnect from any clients which have not responded to a "ping" message within 20 minutes.

To allow nodes to keep track of latency, the "pong" message sends back the same nonce received in the "ping" message it is replying to.

The format of the "pong" message is identical to the "ping" message; only the message header differs.

\startformat
nonce
uint64
Random nonce assigned to this "ping" message. The responding "pong" message will include this nonce to identify the "ping" message to which it is replying. See BIP-31 for details.
