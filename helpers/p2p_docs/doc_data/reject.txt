message
string
The type of message rejected as ASCII text *without null padding*. For example: “tx”, “block”, or “version”.

code
char
The reject message code. See the table below.

reason
string
The reason for the rejection in ASCII text. This should not be displayed to the user; it is only for debugging purposes. May be an empty string.

extra data
uint256
Optional additional data provided with the rejection. For example, most rejections of "tx" messages or "block" messages include the hash of the rejected transaction or block header. See the code table below.
\endformat

The following table lists message reject codes. Codes are tied to the type of message they reply to; for example there is a 0x10 reject code for transactions and a 0x10 reject code for blocks.

\starttable Code, In Reply To, Extra Bytes, Extra Type, Description
0x01
*any message*
0
N/A
Message could not be decoded. Be careful of "reject" message feedback loops where two peers each don’t understand each other’s "reject" messages and so keep sending them back and forth forever.

0x10
"block" message
32
uint256
Block is invalid for some reason (invalid proof-of-work, invalid signature, etc). Extra data may include the rejected block’s header hash.

0x10
"tx" message
32
uint256
Transaction is invalid for some reason (invalid signature, output value greater than input, etc.). Extra data may include the rejected transaction’s TXID.

0x11
"block" message
32
uint256
The block uses a version that is no longer supported. Extra data may include the rejected block’s header hash.

0x11
"version" message
0
N/A
Connecting node is using a protocol version that the rejecting node considers obsolete and unsupported.

0x12
"tx" message
32
uint256
Duplicate input spend (double spend): the rejected transaction spends the same input as a previously-received transaction. Extra data may include the rejected transaction’s TXID.

0x12
"version" message
0
N/A
More than one "version" message received in this connection.

0x40
"tx" message
32
uint256
The transaction will not be mined or relayed because the rejecting node considers it non-standard—a transaction type or version unknown by the server. Extra data may include the rejected transaction’s TXID.

0x41
"tx" message
32
uint256
One or more output amounts are below the dust threshold. Extra data may include the rejected transaction’s TXID.

0x42
"tx" message
32
uint256
The transaction did not have a large enough fee or priority to be relayed or mined. Extra data may include the rejected transaction’s TXID.

0x43
"block" message
32
uint256
The block belongs to a block chain which is not the same block chain as provided by a compiled-in checkpoint. Extra data may include the rejected block’s header hash.
