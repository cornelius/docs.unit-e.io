It allows a peer which has been disconnected or started for the first time to get the headers it hasnâ€™t seen yet.

The "getheaders" message is nearly identical to the "getblocks" message, with one minor difference: the ``inv`` reply to the "getblocks" message will include no more than 500 block header hashes; the ``headers`` reply to the "getheaders" message will include as many as 2,000 block headers.

\startformat
version
uint32
The protocol version number; the same as sent in the "version" message.

hash count
CompactSize
The number of header hashes provided not including the stop hash. There is no limit except that the byte size of the entire message must be below the ["MAX_SIZE"](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/60abd463ac2eaa8bc1d616d8c07880dc53d97211/src/serialize.h#L23) limit; typically from 1 to 200 hashes are sent.

block header hashes
uint256[]
One or more block header hashes (32 bytes each) in internal byte order. Hashes should be provided in reverse order of block height, so highest-height hashes are listed first and lowest-height hashes are listed last.

stop hash
uint256
The header hash of the last header hash being requested; set to all zeroes to request an "inv" message with all subsequent header hashes (a maximum of 2000 will be sent as a reply to this message; if you need more than 2000, you will need to send another "getheaders" message with a higher-height header hash as the first entry in block header hash field).
