If a TCP/IP error is encountered when sending the "ping" message (such as a connection timeout), the transmitting node can assume that the receiving node is disconnected. The response to a "ping" message is the "pong" message.

The message includes a single field, the nonce.

\startformat
nonce
uint64
Random nonce assigned to this "ping" message. The responding "pong" message will include this nonce to identify the "ping" message to which it is replying. See BIP-31 for details.
