Inventory type. Used by ["inv"](message:inv) and other messages.

\startformat
type identifier
uint32
The type of object which was hashed. See list of type identifiers below.

hash
uint256
SHA256(SHA256()) hash of the object in internal byte order.
\endformat

The currently-available type identifiers are:

\starttable Type Identifier, Name, Description
1
"MSG_TX"
The hash is a TXID.

2
"MSG_BLOCK"
The hash is of a block header.

3
"MSG_FILTERED_BLOCK"
The hash is of a block header; identical to "MSG_BLOCK". When used in a "getdata" message, this indicates the response should be a "merkleblock" message rather than a "block" message (but this only works if a bloom filter was previously configured). **Only for use in**\ "getdata" messages\ **.**

4
"MSG_CMPCT_BLOCK"
The hash is of a block header; identical to "MSG_BLOCK". When used in a "getdata" message, this indicates the response should be a "cmpctblock" message. **Only for use in**\ "getdata" messages\ **.**

5
"MSG_WITNESS_BLOCK"
The hash is of a block header; identical to "MSG_BLOCK". When used in a "getdata" message, this indicates the response should be a block message with transactions that have a witness using witness serialization. **Only for use in**\ "getdata" messages\ **.**

6
"MSG_WITNESS_TX"
The hash is a TXID. When used in a "getdata" message, this indicates the response should be a transaction message, if the witness structure is nonempty, the witness serialization will be used. **Only for use in**\ "getdata" messages\ **.**

7
"MSG_FILTERED_WITNESS_BLOCK"
Reserved for future use.
\endtable

Type identifier zero and type identifiers greater than seven are reserved for future implementations. unit-e ignores all inventories with one of these unknown types.
