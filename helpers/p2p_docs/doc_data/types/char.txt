A character represented as an unsigned 8 bit value. The representation is equivalent to [uint8](type:Integers).

Characters are often used as part of variable sized strings as a ``vector<char>`` which is equivalent to [string](type:string) or as part of a fixed size string. This is represented in the form ``char[size]`` where size is the number of characters in the string.
