Block headers are serialized in the 140-byte format described below and then hashed as part of Unit-e’s proof-of-stake algorithm, making the serialized header format part of the consensus rules.

\startformat
version
int32
The block version number indicates which set of block validation rules to follow. See the list of block versions below.

previous block header hash
uint256
A SHA256(SHA256()) hash in internal byte order of the previous block’s header. This ensures no previous block can be changed without also changing this block’s header.

merkle root hash
uint256
A SHA256(SHA256()) hash in internal byte order. The merkle root is derived from the hashes of all transactions included in this block, ensuring that none of those transactions can be modified without modifying the header. See the [merkle trees section](intro:merkle-trees) for details.

witness merkle root hash
uint256
Hash of witness merkle root

finalizer commits merkle root
uint256
Hash of merkle root of finalizer commits

time
uint32
The block time is a [Unix epoch time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) when the miner started hashing the header (according to the miner). Must be strictly greater than the median time of the previous 11 blocks. Full nodes will not accept blocks with headers more than two hours in the future according to their clock.

nBits
uint32
An encoded version of the target threshold this block’s header hash must be less than or equal to. See the nBits format described below.
\endformat

The hashes are in internal byte order; the other values are all in little-endian order.
