Network IP address of a peer.

\startformat
services
uint64
The services the node advertised in its "version" message.

IP address
char[16]
IPv6 address in **big endian byte order**. IPv4 addresses can be provided as [IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6#IPv4-mapped_IPv6_addresses)

port
uint8[2]
Port number in **big endian byte order**. Note that Bitcoin Core will only connect to nodes with non-standard port numbers as a last resort for finding peers. This is to prevent anyone from trying to use the network to disrupt non-Unit-e  services that run on other ports.
